# Zuri
15th March, 2021 - I started my training on the as a back end trainee specializing in Python.
29th March, 2021- I created a mock atm project.

A repository of projects I am working on during my Zuri Training.

Projects:

Mock ATM Project: The user should see the current date and time after they log in.

When the user selects option 1, they should be presented with the following:

- How much would you like to withdraw (receive input from the user), output "take your cash"
When the user selects option 2, present them with the following options:
- How much would you like to deposit? (receive input from the user), output current balance.
When the user selects complaint, present them with the following options:
- What issue will you like to report? (Receive input from the user), output "Thank you for contacting us"

I used lists, dictionary, if and else statements,try and except statements, string methods, input and arithmetic operands.
Updated the mock ATM to involve airtime transactions and an account balance feature


Budget App:
Create a Budget class that can instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. These objects should allow for
- Depositing funds to each of the categories
- Withdrawing funds from each category
- Computing category balances
- Transferring balance amounts between categories
