# Zuri
15th March, 2021 - I started my training on the as a back end trainee specializing in Python.
29th March, 2021- I created a mock atm project.
A repository of projects I am working on during my Zuri Training.

Projects:

Mock ATM Project: The user should see the current date and time after they log in

When the user selects option 1, they should be presented with the following:

- How much would you like to withdraw (receive input from the user), output "take your cash"
When the user selects option 2, present them with the following options:
- How much would you like to deposit? (receive input from the user), output current balance.
When the user selects complaint, present them with the following options:
- What issue will you like to report? (Receive input from the user), output "Thank you for contacting us"

I used lists, dictionary, if and else statements,try and except statements, string methods, input and arithmetic operands.
